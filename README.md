embeddings.ipynb includes:
- Dataset pre-processing: We apply 18 transformations to a subset of 346 images from the Instagram Images (Kaggle) dataset
- An exploration of CLIP, ISC21, and ResNet50 embedding models in the context of image similarity where we generate embeddings, calculate cosine similarity for a group of images and compare median aggregations
- Exploration of how low cosine similarity scores can be for look-alikes (in an attempt to determine a suitable threshold value)
